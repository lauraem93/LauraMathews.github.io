**Questions**

What are your thoughts on R vs whatever other software you've used?  What functionality do you like about R?  
What parts do you miss about your other language?  
Do you consider R a difficult language to learn? (If you knew R prior to the course, describe your experience when first learning it.)

**Answers**

The only other software that I have experience using is SAS. 

If there is anything I miss about SAS, it is that SAS gives you a lot of output from just one step. From what I have seen so far in R, you seem to have to ask R for everything you want. For example there is a separate function for mean and standard deviation, where as in SAS you can use proc means to get a lot of different summary statistics on different variables with just one statement. I'm sure there may be packages and functions to do this in R that I just haven't learned about yet!

I have had a few R projects in other classes, prior to taking the required ST555 course. I struggled a lot using R. I had very little programming experience and no experience with R specifically. Now that I have had some experience programming, I think I am able to understand in general how programming works and I am finding it much easier to learn.
