Write a blog post to respond to the prompt below:

Go back and read your initial blog post where we discussed data science as well as your blog post about your thoughts on R.  Write a reflection post about:

What (if anything) has changed about what you think a data scientist is and what they do?

I have learned a lot more about what is involved in data science. Prior to this class, I didn't know much about what a data scientist is or does. I definitely appreciate the complixity and problem solving required to be a good data scientist.

What your current thoughts are in terms of using R for data science - do you think you'll continue to use R going forward?  Why or why not?

I think R is a good tool for data science, it is relatively straightforward and has all of the capabilities to do data science. Yes I will continue to use R going forward. Now that I have some knowledge of how to use R, I do see myself using it for future assignments. I have also found it very easy to use the help files to learn how to use new functions. It is also easy to find information online on doing different things in R that weren't explicitly taught in class. R now seems relatively straightforward to use and easy to find help when needed. For these reasons, I will continue using R.

What things are you going to do differently in practice now that you've had this course?

I don't do a lot of programming in my work or outside of school. I have learned how write code that is more efficient, ie with functions and vectorization. I will continue to do this now that I have had this course. I have also begun using R to create plots for assignments in different classes because I like the flexibility and aesthetics of ggplot2. I will likely continue to use R for assignments that require plots.
