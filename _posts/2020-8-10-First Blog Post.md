What do you think being a data scientist is about?

Being a data scientists involves using data to provide prodictive models. It is a broad term that can cover different areas including data analystics and machine learning.

What do you see as the major duties and/or knowledge areas? 

A data scientist has to understand statistics and programming. Two of the articles emphasized the need to also really understand the product about which they are creating models. A data scientist also must be able to communicate models well to businesses and clients.

What differences/similarities do you see between data scientists and statisticians?

A data scientist uses more/larger data sets than a statistician. Both use models to analyze data; however, the method used to choose the best model is different. Data scientists compare models and determine the best one to be the one that provides the most accurate prediction. On the other hand, statisticians start with a simple model and approve upon it based on the context of the problem. One article mentioned that statisticians spend more time calculating the uncertainty associated with their models than data scientists do. Overall, there seems to be more of a continuum between the two than a distinct line. There is a lot of overlap in what each does, but, based on the arguments in the articles, data scientists seem to be more concerned with making predictions and have more programming abilities while statisticians use data to determine relationships and have a stronger math and statistics background.

How do you view yourself in relation to these two areas?

My academic background is in biology and I currently work in professional athletics. I have a little programming experience, but not much. I think I am closer to being a statistician than a data scientist. However, I really enjoy learning about data analytics.
