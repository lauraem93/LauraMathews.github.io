**Project description:**

The purpose of this project was to create predictive tree models and automate RMarkdown reports. Data collected on bike sharing was used to predict the count of bikes used on a particular day. Then reports were created for each day of the week.

**What would you do differently?**

While working on my project, I would have cut the data set down greatly to reduce run time. I only used one day while writing and testing different code chunks, however, some of these chunks still took a very long time to run. I could have been more efficient while choosing variables, parameters, etc if I had only had 300 observations instead of nearly 2000.

**What was the most difficult part for you?**

I had difficulty choosing parameters for each model. I wanted to create a model that would predict well on the data for any day, and the optimal parameters may be different for each day. However, I also did not want to give so many parameter options that the code would take hours to run. I struggled with automating the reports as well. In particular, I had difficulty figuring out what to include in the params in the YAML header of my predictive modeling code that would allow the program to be automated.

**What are your big take-aways from this project?**

Through working with predictive models both in the homework and this project, I have learned how important it is to understand the data set you are working with. Predictive models also can take a long time to run, so it is better to write more at a time and check your code chunks rather than testing code chunks many many times.
